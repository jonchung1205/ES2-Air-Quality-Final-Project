# ES2-Air-Quality-Final-Project

Poor air quality is a concern in many urban populations, and the objective of this project was to analyze trends in the concentration of various urban air contaminants in New York City between the years 2009-2020 using ppm as a metric. 

Other aspects of the project include: 
  - Statistical tests
    - Determine whether or not the trends were statistically significant between years
    - Determine whether or not contaminant concentrations were significant across boroughs
    - Determine whether or not there was a correlation between contaminant concentration and seasonal changes
   
  - Spatial Analysis
    - Divide boroughs based on latitude and longitude
    - Visualize contamination concentrations using geoscatter
