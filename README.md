# ES2-Air-Quality-Final-Project

Poor air quality is a concern in many urban populations, and the objective of this project was to analyze trends in the concentration of various urban air contaminants in New York City between the years 2009-2020 using ppm as a metric. 

Other aspects of the project include: 
  - Statistical tests
    - Determining whether or not the trends are statistically significant between years
    - Determining whether or not contaminant concentrations are significant across boroughs
    - Determine whether or not there is a correlation between contaminant concentration and seasonal changes
   
  - Spatial Analysis
    - Dividing boroughs based on latitude and longitude
    - Visualizing contamination concentrations using geoscatter
